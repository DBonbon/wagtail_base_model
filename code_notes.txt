ALLAUTH
All account templates for allauth should go into the directory account/ of your app,
in our case userauth/templates/userauth/account/, so create this directory.

Be careful: the directory with the templates is called account/,
while the url's have an extra s: /accounts/…/.
So the url …/accounts/login/ uses the template …/account/login.html.


all allauth templates are multilingual by default,
i.e. they use the template tags trans loaded with {% load i18n %}.

NB - to keep the templates in the userauth directory and not move it to project templates...

don't know why but it functions only like this.


BOOTSTRAP AND ALLAUTH FORMS
Using Bootstrap we have created a new base template with three blocks
card-header, card-body and card-footer, to make our templates look nicer.
We are going to divide our ALLAUT forms/.html template in these three parts


form_field.html (which appears in login.html for ex):
If the form is bound, i.e. if it has already been submitted before (perhaps with errors),
$then any errors are displayed or the field is 'green' and validated.
If it is the first time the form is shown, then the field is rendered with the
field name added as the last part of the class, so that it can be styled differently if needed.

This is done with widget_tweaks,
which provides Alarm colors and text when the data is wrongly entered, etc.


GIT
Create a git repository;
 Copy the <link> to the repository.
 Go to the project directory

git init
git remote add origin <link>

This initializes git in your project directory and ties it to the remote repository.


then type the following:
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin master


All content is now in your remote repository. Every time you want to update your remote repository,
repeat the last three commands (with "initial commit" replaced by a meaningful message).


SETTINGS

security:  Create local.py
Wagtail intends to use this file for local settings that should never be tracked,
such as secret keys and passwords.

let's put a (truly) secret key in there


python3 manage.py shell
At the prompt type:

from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
get_random_secret_key()

Copy the string with the secret key and leave the shell with Ctrl-D. Put in local.py:

SECRET_KEY = '<the secret key>'

This will override the one in dev.py.


SHELL
CNRL+Z OR exit()

Tags Filters

|default.
When fields are undefined, the value None is displayed in the template.
To prevent this, we use Django's filter default, which displays nothing (an empty string).
